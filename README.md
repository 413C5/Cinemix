# Cinemix

Cinemix is a website developed for a fictional cinema where users can simulate booking tickets across different available theaters. To maintain a consistent design, a master page was used as a template for all pages, along with server controls to manage interactivity.

For efficient movie information management, an SQL Server database was employed. To simplify querying and management, Entity Framework was used along with LINQ for making queries.
